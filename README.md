# Particle-System-on-3D-Engine
Simulation of fire

Simulation of fire effects in a 3D Engine developped by the research team in Graphics of the University of Limoges, France. Since the code of this particular 3D engine belongs to the lab it will not be provided here, only my particle system mechanism will be present.
